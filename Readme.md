ACME client library for ESP32

Copyright (c) 2019, 2020 by Danny Backx

ACME is a protocol (see RFC8555) for automatic certificate management.
Sites such as letsencrypt.org allow you to obtain free (no charge) certificates in an automated way
using the ACME protocol.

This library allows you to get certificates for IoT devices based on the ESP32.
